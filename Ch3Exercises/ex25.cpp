/*
Define a float variable.
 Take its address, cast that address to an unsigned char,
 and assign it to an unsigned char pointer.
 Using this pointer and [ ],
 index into the float variable and use the printBinary( ) function
  defined in this chapter to print out a map of the float
  (go from 0 to sizeof(float)).
  Change the value of the float and see
  if you can figure out whatâ€™s going on
  (the float contains encoded data).
